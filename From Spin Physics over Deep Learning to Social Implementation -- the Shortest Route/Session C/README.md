## Deep Learning Introduction with a Flavour of Computer Vision (Prof. Hayaru SHOUNO, Dept. J)

### Fundamental concepts of deep learning and the application

### Historical background of deep learning and basic architectures of neural networks (CNNs)

In this lecture, we introduce the fundamental concepts of deep learning and several application examples in the field of computer vision. Deep learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that enables the learning of complex patterns from data through hierarchical feature extraction. Computer vision is one of the fields in which deep learning has made significant contributions, achieving breakthrough results in tasks such as image recognition, object detection, segmentation, and image generation. 

Starting with the historical background of deep learning, we discuss and explain basic architectures such as neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Furthermore, we cover important topics related to datasets, evaluation metrics, and learning methods, as well as presenting application examples of deep learning in computer vision. The aim of this presentation is to provide valuable information that will help students, researchers, and engineers with an interest in deep learning and computer vision to better understand and apply these technologies.
